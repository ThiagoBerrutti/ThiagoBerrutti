### Hello! 

I'm Thiago Berrutti, a .NET developer passionate with learning new ways to write clean, elegant, reusable and self-documented code to solve problems. 

I recommend you to check my [Store Manager REST API demo repository](https://github.com/ThiagoBerrutti/store-manager) to see some of my work.

Feel free to see my other public repositories, too. Thanks!
